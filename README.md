# CISO Interview Questions
This is a collection of questions to ask about the team and company when you're interviewing for a CISO position. I think most of it is also relevant for other security leadership roles.

## Company
* Does the company tolerate brilliant jerks?
* Is the company sometimes willing to make culture or engineering tradeoffs in favor of security?
* What's the company's risk management strategy?
* How are decisions made and communicated?
* How are priorities decided between teams?
* Does the company support community engagement, like speaking at conferences or contributing back to open source projects?
* How important is managing a budget? Is the company willing to spend as needed, or is a lot of justification required?

## Team
* What is the team’s current make up in terms of seniority and expertise?
* Do they seem happy? Is anyone on the team likely to leave? Looking for growth that they can’t get here? Possibly upset by hiring externally for this role?
* What are the major projects you foresee for the security team?
* Is the team likely to grow and require hiring? Any missing skills that you can think of?
* Does the CISO have authority to fire poor performers as a last resort?
* How is security viewed by other teams?
* How is the work/life balance like on the security team?
* What's the ratio of reactive to proactive work?
* Is there an on-call rotation or is everyone on-call all the time?

## Role
* Who does the CISO report to?
* Are priorities and incentives aligned between the CISO and management?
* If you could focus on the CISO role fulltime yourself, what would you do?
* How do you measure success for this role?

## Technical
* How important are firewalls to your security model? (Where are you on the spectrum between a strong perimeter/soft middle and full zero trust?)
* What is the company’s approach to technical debt?
* Is the company moving towards cloud and away from on-prem systems, or is the long-term plan a hybrid solution?
* What does the tech stack look like at a high level? Programming languages, operating systems, open source vs. commercial?

## Tactical
* How are IT support and operational responsibilities handled?
* What’s the travel policy? Do employees fly business class on longer trips?
* Do people get offices or is it an open space environment?
* What’s the vacation policy?
* How close to the office do most people live?
* Is working from home once in a while practical?
